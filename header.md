# CoMeta Ontology

An extension of Music Meta to describe the metadata of music collections, corpora, containers, or simply music datasets! Here, metadata is described at the collection-level (data curator, annotations provided, availability of audio music, etc.), and at the content-level, (e.g., the title, artist, release of each piece in a dataset). The design of CoMeta is informed by a survey of Music Information Retrieval datasets, which allowed for the categorisation of common fields.
